	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>DePo Clean is the default theme for Melody 1.0. It is derived from <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/516">a WordPress theme by the same name</a> by Derek Powazek. It is a minimalist theme intended to give a sharp and clean display of your content. By default, it publishes a main page, an atom feed, individual entry archives, comment feeds and listing archives (monthly, category and author by default). It comes with several widgets.</p>

	<h1>Theme Options</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#flickr">Flickr</a></li>
		<li><a href="#listing-widgets">Listing Widgets</a></li>
		<li><a href="#per-page-entry-limits">Per Page Entry Limits</a></li>
		<li><a href="#user-and-site-metadata">User and Site Metadata</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="flickr">Flickr</h2>
	<p>In order to use the provided Flickr support, you will need to get your Flickr ID. <a href="http://idgettr.com/">Go here</a> to get yours if you don't have know what it is. The Flickr module supports several variations. For all of them you will need to have your Flickr ID in order for Flickr to let you interface with it. For a group gallery, you will also need to have the group's ID code as well.</p>

	<h2 id="listing-widgets">Listing Widgets</h2>
	<p>This section allows you to control how many items will be displayed in three of the widgets:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Monthly archives</li>
		<li>Recent comments</li>
		<li>Recent entries</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="per-page-entry-limits">Per Page Entry Limits</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this section is to allow fine-grained control of how many entries are displayed on each of the page types which display more than one entry.</p>

	<h2 id="user-and-site-metadata">User and Site Metadata</h2>
	<p>This section allows you to enter text to provide additional information about your blog, contact information and set up the Action Streams plugin.</p>
